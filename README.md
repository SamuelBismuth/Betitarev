# Betitarev

A repository for the assignment of the course Software Engineering shared with  [@yoshago]( https://github.com/yoshago ) and [@Yishay1]( https://github.com/Yishay1 ).  

Everyone has already heard about betting. A lot of big companies have exploited all the resources (sports, horses...), using fictive or real money.  
The problem is, each bet is chosen by the company itself. What if someone want to bet about the number of windows there are in the room, or if he will success the course Software Engineering with grade of at least 85 ?  
Given two bettors (at least), and one judge, our application is a plat-form in which all the bet will run out.  
Let call Tic the first bettor and Tacthe second bettor. Tic is sure than the number of stars in the American flag is 42 and Tac thinks that there are 50 stars. Let Toc be the judge of the bet. Assuming that Tic, Tac, and Toc are already registered in our database, either Tic or Tac must create a new match with the exact bet. Toc designates the winner of the bet.  
The general idea is to put what we call a ”bet friend” into an application.  
  
# Implementation Tasks

Assuming that all the task required back and front-end, and even phone configuration such that sending notification.
